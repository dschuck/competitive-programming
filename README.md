# Solutions to Competitive Programming problems

This is my main repository for everything practice and contest problem-y, at the moment it includes quizzes, problems and practice from:

- [Advent of Code](advent-of-code/README.md) ([site](https://adventofcode.com/))


Caution: This is a personal repository, only made public in the rare case someone may find it useful or to share solutions with others, but:
- these solutions may be broken or not work for you.
- I almost guarrantee that some solutions may not be best in algorithmic complexity terms.

All code is under the _Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License_, see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
